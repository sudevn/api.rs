## Introduction

This project is a minimal REST API server built in Rust, aimed at helping you get started with web development using Rust. It handles basic HTTP operations such as `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE`, and is structured in a way that can be easily extended to more complex use cases.

The server is built using the [Actix-web](https://actix.rs/) framework for fast, asynchronous request handling. You can use it as a base for your own API server or extend it with additional functionality.

## Features
- **Basic Routing:** Set up routes for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- **JSON Handling:** Accept and return JSON data.
- **Error Handling:** Provides simple error responses.
- **Extensible:** Easily extendable with more complex logic, authentication, and database support.

## Requirements

- **Rust**: 1.60.0 or newer.
- **Cargo**: Cargo comes bundled with Rust, so no additional installation is necessary.

## Installation

To get started with the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sudevn/api.rs.git
   cd api.rs
